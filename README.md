# IllumioCodingChallenge2018
Host-Based Firewall - Java

# Introduction
Assignment

# Background
A core component of Illumio’s product is a host-based firewall. As a simplified model, consider
a firewall to be a system which is programmed with a set of predetermined security rules. As
network traffic enters and leaves the machine, the firewall rules determine whether the traffic
should be allowed or blocked.
Real-world firewalls support both “allow” and “block” rules, and their ordering is important in
determining the fate of a packet. In this coding exercise, we will greatly simplify this model by
only supporting “allow” rules. If a packet does not match any “allow” rule, then we assume it
will be blocked.
